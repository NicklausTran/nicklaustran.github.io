### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

Lab 10, part 1 was my favorite lab because I was able to organize data about Californias population through writing vectors. The vector that I wrote helped give me counties population and the percentage of the state population that lived in the county which I found fascinating

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 1 was my second favorite lab because of the creativity of MadLibs. In this lab, I wrote a function that allowed for a play on words with sandwiches. I found this lab fun because I was able to make a pun on words with this lab.

* Lab 8

Lab 8, part 1 was my third favorite lab because I was able to compute a function that helped me write the average score from judges. I enjoyed figuring out the math behind this lab and enjoyed combining all my previous knowledge of previous labs.
